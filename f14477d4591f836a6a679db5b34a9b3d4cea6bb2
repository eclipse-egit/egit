      "message": "I had doubts this was true:\n\n\u003e You can override the default tool per folder and per file type, using the .gitattributes file in a folder. The override will apply for subfolders, as long as a subfolder does not override the tool via .gitattributes: \n\nLooking at the code in: org.eclipse.jgit.internal.diffmergetool.ExternalToolUtils.getExternalToolFromAttributes(Repository, String, String)\n\nAnd in particular:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tString treePath \u003d walk.getPathString();\n\t\t\t\t\tif (treePath.equals(path)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAttributes attrs \u003d walk.getAttributes();\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif (attrs.containsKey(toolKey)) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treturn Optional.of(attrs.getValue(toolKey));\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\nBut after testing it, it works.\n\nShould I extend the test to create a merge conflict that is more than 1 folder deep? Would be slightly different to the base I used for the test.",
