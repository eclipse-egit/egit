I want to integrate a feature in egit where the user can review pul requests in eclipse similar to IntelliJ. 
https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-with-github-pull-requests.html#incoming_pull_requests

As first step I want an eclipse view which shows open pull requests in the repository in a list. 
We are using bitbucket data center, to get the pull request use their REST api .
