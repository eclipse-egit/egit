In my case, the code in GitMergeEditorInput.buildDiffContainer() sets kinds \"CONFLICTING\" (12) and \"CHANGE\" (3):\n\nint kind \u003d Differencer.NO_CHANGE;\nif (conflicting) {\n\tkind \u003d Differencer.CONFLICTING + Differencer.CHANGE;\n} else if (modified) {\n\tkind \u003d Differencer.LEFT + Differencer.ADDITION;\n}\n\nBy the looks of it we are supposed to use Differencer.CHANGE_TYPE_MASK here... maybe other masks also. Will have to check.",
