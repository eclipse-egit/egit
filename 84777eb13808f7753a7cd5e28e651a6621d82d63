But apparently nobody cared enough to keep Mylyn alive.\n\nWe should also change the EGit builds to not trigger the egit-github builds anymore.\nAnd the mylyn bundles there also should go.\n\nWhat do we do with org.eclipse.egit.github.core? With Eclipse TLP having moved to Github, it might make sense to keep that one alive.\n\n-1 because of the partial revert in the oomph setup.",

If someone revives Mylyn we can revert this deletion.\n\nYes we should also delete the egit-github builds.\n\nI plan to move org.eclipse.egit.github.core and its tests to the EGit repository.\nQuestion is with or without its history ?\n\nWe can then archive the egit-github repo.\n\nI didn\u0027t intend to revert your oomph setup update. I created this change earlier and didn\u0027t spot this when rebasing it on current master. Should be fixed now.",
