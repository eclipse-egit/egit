      "message": "All list or tree views that have big amounts of items being removed/added lead to their progress bar \"button\" visually growing/shrinking during that refresh operation, because the redraw is called after each item added/removed. At least on Windows that is visible in all kinds of views where the number of items is big enough. It also blocks the UI thread completely, in many cases for several seconds. I\u0027ve previously fixed this the same way in many other places that potentially show many items and refresh the complete contents on selection or similar events. If needed, I can also produce an animated gif with my work IDE (there I have enough branches).",

      "message": "I usually take the tags of the Eclipse Platform UI repo for such tests -- a tag a day makes for a truly long list.\n\nYou mean the scroll bar thumb? I hadn\u0027t paid attention to that. I did notice a UI block on Windows. I trust your word that this fixes it there :-)\n\nIt\u0027s also not really fast on OS X (but faster than on Windows), and the change doesn\u0027t seem to have any effect on OS X.",

      "message": "If you mean to expand/collapse the tags, that is something entirely different. This is for the \"hierarchical layout\" button, which doesn\u0027t expand or collapse, but rather _removes and re-adds_ all the child nodes. And that causes a refresh after each single item being added/removed. You can often force this bug easily in filtered lists/trees. Just type a filter expression that matches nothing, then delete. Repeat as you like. And you will see the scrollbar thumb button of that view growing from 0 to 10000 elements, shrink similarly etc. Previous fixes have been in the about dialog lists, the target platform state view, the launch config plugins list etc.",
