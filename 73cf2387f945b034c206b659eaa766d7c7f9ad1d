That did not trigger any build on Jenkins.\n\nSomething is still not quite right with the Jenkins-GerritHub integration. I do notice that the Jenkins jobs are all set to run with \"Any Server\". In a local Gerrit/Jenkins setup at work we ran into problems with that; we had to choose the right server in the job configuration for jobs to be triggered. Perhaps the GerritTrigger plug-in has a problem? Or the Jenkins needs a restart?\n\n[1] https://eclipse.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-egit/egit/+/1173179",
