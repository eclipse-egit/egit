      "message": "This `chunk` was previously only used in 1 branch of the `if` statement below (`if (commitToLoad !\u003d null)`). I removed it and used the new private method `getNextMaximumCommitsCount()` instead so that both branches of the `if` load the same amount of commits into `loadedCommits`. This decision, together with the fact that now `updateUI(...)` is called inside the `for`-loop, make it possible to show commits to the user in chunks of 256 commits each. For this to work as expected, the underlying `RevWalk` inside `loadedCommits` must be able to deliver chunks of commits (this already happens). In an ideal situation, the `RevWalk` would also only _calculate_ the amount of commits that it needs (256), but `TopoGenerator` currently calculates all of the commits it needs before returning the 1st commit so there is no performance improvement in there. We are working on it though.",
