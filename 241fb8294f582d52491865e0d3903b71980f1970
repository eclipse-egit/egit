      "message": "This is a dangerous route. There may be other views with editable texts. Cell editors in property views? (For instance, all EMF editors; you could try with the Oomph setup.) The console may also accept input and need Ctrl-V to work there. The expressions view from the debugger also may have editable cell editors. Plus we have no idea whatsoever what views contributed by other plug-ins might do or contain.\n\nI don\u0027t know if this can be resolved at all. A wild idea: can we check whether the currently active focus control in the currently active shell is anything that accepts text? (Don\u0027t know if that\u0027s possible, and I don\u0027t know if there is something that makes doing so in a property tester a bad idea -- other than requiring it to run in the UI thread.) And then disable the handler in that case?",
