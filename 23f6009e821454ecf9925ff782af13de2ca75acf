During that time, both builds publish the the same location in the Nexus repo, so EGit picks up whatever build terminated last, which may give such problems.\n\nRe-running the JGit master build once is usually sufficient to resolve the problem.\n\nMatthias will switch master soon to produce 6.3 artifacts, and then this problem will disappear.",
