		<h3 id="History_View">History View</h3>
		<h4 id="Overview_2">Overview</h4>
		<p>The History View for Resources under Git version control is a commit-centric view of the resources in a given Repository. It can be used to perform the following tasks:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Inspecting the change history of a given File under Git version control (viewing and comparing the versions of such a File in the Repository)</li>
			<li>Search for a certain commit using different search criteria</li>
			<li>Check-out of a certain commit</li>
			<li>Creation of branches and tags based on a certain commit</li>
			<li>Creation of patches based on the changes in a certain commit</li>
			<li>Resetting the complete Repository to a certain commit</li>
			<li>Setting and resetting of the quickdiff baseline to a certain commit</li>
		</ul>
		<h4 id="Opening_the_History_View">Opening the History View</h4>
		<p>The History view can be opened by </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Right-clicking
				<b>Show In &gt; History View</b> on any resource under Git version control in the explorer (not available in all Perspectives)
			</li>
			<li>Right-clicking
				<b>Team &gt; Show in History</b> on any resource under Git version control in the explorer
			</li>
			<li>Clicking
				<b>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</b>, then
				<b>Team &gt; History</b>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once the view is open, you can activate the
			<b>Link with Selection</b> button to keep the input of the view in sync with the selection in the explorer automatically.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Organization_of_the_History_View">Organization of the History View</h4>
		<p>The History view is organized in several panes: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The upper pane is the Commit Graph displaying the commit log (or commit history) in reverse chronological order (newest commit on top). Below the commit graph, there are by default two panes: on the left side, the Revision Comment area, which shows the commit message and a textual Diff of the file or files in the commit, and on the right side, the Revision Detail area, which shows a table of the files that were changed by the commit.</p>
		<p>The first column of this table describes the nature of the change for each file:</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>
				<b>ADD</b> &nbsp;the file was added by the commit
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<b>MODIFY</b> &nbsp;the file was modified by the commit
			</dd>
			<dd>
				<b>DELETE</b> &nbsp;the file was deleted by the commit
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>The content of the lower panes depends on the selection in the upper pane and is updated automatically when this selection changes.</p>
		<p>Both lower panes can be switched on and and off separately by right-clicking anywhere in the upper pane and selecting
			<b>Show Revision Comment</b> and
			<b>Show Revision Details</b>, respectively.
		</p>
		<p>Above the Commit Graph, the current input is visualized. The input is always a workspace resource, either a project, a folder, or a file. After the type of the input, the path is shown, followed by the name of the Repository containing the resource in square brackets.</p>
		<h4 id="Using_the_History_View">Using the History View</h4>
		<h5 id="Inspecting_the_Commit_Graph">Inspecting the Commit Graph</h5>
		<p>The Commit Graph area is the main part of the History View. By default, it shows the currently checked out commit and all its ancestors, i.e. the first entry in the list is the checked out commit.
			The following picture is used to explain some of the features of the History View:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-branchAndMerge.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Each line in the Commit Graph corresponds to a commit. Branches, tags and HEAD are visualized as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The tips of local branches are shown as green rectangles</li>
			<li>The tips of remote branches are shown as grey rectangles</li>
			<li>The local HEAD is shown as a white rectangle</li>
			<li>Tags are shown as yellow rectangles</li>
		</ul>
		<p>(our example doesn't have remote branches).</p>
		<p>The line on the left side is the actual commit graph, which shows the parent-child relation of the commits in the list (each commit has at least one parent, except for the very first commit in a Repository).
			There can be forks, which correspond to a branch operation, and joins, which correspond to a merge operation. In our example, there was a branch "experimental" created after the commit with branch "beforeSplit", and the same file was changed both in the "master" and in the "experimental" branch. The last commit is a merge commit where the content of the "experimental" branch was merged with the "master" branch.</p>
		<p>The exact change can be inspected by marking a commit and looking at the Revision Comment area. When scrolling down in the Revision Comment area, a textual diff for the changes will be visible, in our example it says that the content of Project1/f1/file1.txt was changed from "modified" to "modified in master". When selecting the next commit (which corresponds to the "experimental" branch), a similar diff would be displayed, saying that the content of that file was changed from "modified" to "modified in experimental". The newest commit is the result of merging "experimental" into "master". Accordingly, the new commit has two ancestors and the "master" and "experimental" lines are joined again.</p>
		<h5 id="Displaying_and_Comparing_versions_of_a_File">Displaying and Comparing versions of a File</h5>
		<p>If the current input is already a file, right-clicking
			<b>Open</b> on a commit will open an editor with the file content corresponding to the currently selected commit. If the file does not exist in the selected commit, an error message will be displayed. Clicking
			<b>Compare with working tree</b> will open a compare editor comparing the file content of the currently selected commit with the file content in the workspace.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-openAndCompare.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The
			<b>Open</b> and
			<b>Compare with working tree</b> actions can also be executed by double-clicking on a commit: if the "Compare Mode" toolbar button (see below) is down,
			<b>Compare with working tree</b> will be executed, otherwise
			<b>Open</b>.
		</p>
		<p>It is possible to compare the file contents of two commits by selecting the two commits and right-clicking on
			<b>Compare with Each Other</b>.
		</p>
		<p>Furthermore, it is possible to select any number of commits and right-click
			<b>Open</b> to see all versions of the file corresponding to the selected commits (one editor will be opened per version).
		</p>
		<p>If the current input is not a file, then there won't be menu actions for
			<b>Open</b> and
			<b>Compare</b>. However, it is possible to double-click on an entry the Revision Detail area. If compare mode is active, a compare editor will be openend showing the changes for the file being double-clicked in the currently selected commit (i.e. a diff of the file content in the currently selected commit against the file content of this commit's ancestor). If compare mode is not active, an editor with the file content corresponding to the currently selected commit is shown.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-openAndCompareFromDetails.png"/>
		</p>
		<h5 id="Working_with_the_Filter_Settings">Working with the Filter Settings</h5>
		<p>The filter settings can be changed using the corresponding toolbar actions (see below). By default, the "Resource" setting is active, i.e. only those commits are shown in the list that contain changes for the current input. If the current input is not a file, all commits are shown that contain changes for any child of the current input.</p>
		<p>If the filter setting is "Resource" and the current input is a file, then the list of commits contains only those commits that contain changes for that file. This is useful when analyzing the history of that file. In some cases, however, it is helpful to also see other commits which do not change the actual file. For example, it may be interesting to see whether a given change in the file was before or after some other commit which does not change that file itself. In our example, we might want to know whether a given change was "before" or "after" the commit tagged as "Project1". By changing the filter setting from "Resource" to "Repository", this is easily done:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-filtersettings.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The behavior of the other two settings ("Folder" and "Project") is similar in that they include the commits that change any resource in the parent folder of the current input or any resource in the project of the current input, respectively. In our example above, if filter setting "Project" would be used, the commit "Add Project2 to Repository" would not be shown, is it doesn't change anything in the project of the current input (Project1/f1/file1.txt).</p>
		<p>Alternatively, in order to see all commits pertaining to a specific project, one could change the history view input to that project. However, the file-specific menu actions would then not be available.</p>
		<h4 id="Toolbar_actions">Toolbar actions</h4>
		<p>The first four buttons in the History View's toolbar are the standard buttons for Refresh, Link with Selection, Pinning and Navigation History.</p>
		<h5 id="Find">Find</h5>
		<p>If the "Find" toolbar button is down, a search bar is displayed in the lower part of the view which allows to search for commits in the commit log. Depending on the setting in the drop-down list in the search bar the commit's title, comment, author or committer are searched.</p>
		<p>The found search hits are high-lighted in bold and the "Next" and "Previous" buttons allow to jump to the next or previous commit matching the search criteria:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-search.png"/>
		</p>
		<h5 id="Filter_settings">Filter settings</h5>
		<p>The next four toggle buttons in the the view toolbar control how the displayed commits are filtered with respect to the current input:
			<br/>

			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-config.png"/>
			<br/>
			The buttons are working as radio buttons, i.e. one of the four buttons must always be down.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the "Repository" button is down, the commit log is not filtered and shows all commits reachable from the currently checked out branch (or all commits, see below about the "All Branches" action)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If the "Project" button is down, the commit log is filtered to show all commits which affected any of the resources in the project containing the current input</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If the "Folder" toggle is down, the commit log is filtered to show all commits which affected any of the resources in the parent folder of the current input</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If the "Resource" button is down, the commit log is filtered to show only commits which affected the current input</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that not all combinations of filter setting and current input are meaningful; for example, if the current input is a project, the "Project" option is in fact the same as the "Resource" option.</p>
		<h5 id="Compare_Mode">Compare Mode</h5>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-comparemode.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The next button is again a toggle, activating "Compare Mode". If  it is down, certain double-click actions (see above) will open a compare editor instead of a normal editor.</p>
		<h5 id="All_Branches">All Branches</h5>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-allbranches.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This toggle activates the "All Branches" mode. By default, only those commits are shown in the commit log that can be reached from the currently checked out commit, i.e. the Commit Graph ends with the currently checked out commit and newer commits are not shown. If this button is down, all commits will be shown in the commit log. This is illustrated in the following picture from our example. The branch "beforeSplit" is currently checked out; by activating the toggle, the newer branches will become visible:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-allbranchesToggle.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="View_Menu_actions">View Menu actions</h4>
		<h5 id="Configuring_the_View">Configuring the View</h5>
		<p>Most of the toolbar actions are available in the View Menu, too. In addition, the following four toggles are available:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-viewmenu.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>"Show Revision Details" toggles the Revision Detail area and "Show Revision Comment" the Revision Comment area. The "Wrap Comments" and "Fill paragraphs" actions are only available if "Show Revision Comment" is active and govern the formatting within the Revision Comment area.</p>
		<p>The first two actions are also available by right-clicking anywhere in the Commit Graph area, and the last two actions are also available by right-clicking anywhere in the Revision Comment area.</p>
		<h4 id="Context_Menu_actions">Context Menu actions</h4>
		<p>The context menu in the Commit Graph area is slightly different, depending on whether the current is a File or a Folder/Project, respectively. The following menu entries are always available:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-contextMenuFolder.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>If the current input is a File, there are some other actions available; if exactly one commit is selected, there are two additional options:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-contextMenuSingleFile.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>and if exactly two commits are selected, the menu will appear like this:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-history-view-contextMenuTwoFiles.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>If more than two commits are selected, only the "Open" action and the "Quickdiff" menu will be available.</p>
		<h5 id="Compare_with_working_tree">Compare with working tree</h5>
		<p>This action is only available if the current input is a file and a single commit is selected. It will open a compare editor comparing the file content of the selected commit with the file content in the working tree.</p>
		<h5 id="Compare_with_each_other">Compare with each other</h5>
		<p>This action is only available if the current input is a file and exactly two commits are selected. It will open a compare editor comparing the file content of the selected commits with each other.</p>
		<h5 id="Open">Open</h5>
		<p>This action is only available if the current input is a file. It will open an editor for each selected commit displaying the content of the file for the given commit. </p>
		<h5 id="Checkout">Checkout</h5>
		<p>This checks out the currently selected commit. If a branch exists for this commit, the branch is checked out, if more than one branch exists for this commit, a dialog will be shown asking which branch should be checked out. If no branches exist for the commit, the commit will be checked out and HEAD will become detached.</p>
		<h5 id="Create_Branch...">Create Branch...</h5>
		<p>Creates a branch on the currently selected commit. A dialog will be shown asking for a branch name and whether the newly created branch should be checked out.</p>
		<h5 id="Create_Tag...">Create Tag...</h5>
		<p>Creates a tag on the currently selected commit. A dialog will be shown asking for a tag name and a tag message.</p>
		<h5 id="Create_Patch...">Create Patch...</h5>
		<p>This action is not available on the very first commit of a Repository. It will create a patch containing the changes of the currently selected commit compared to that commit's predecessor. A dialog will be shown asking whether the patch should be created as file or in the clipboard and whether to use the Git patch format of the generic patch format.</p>
		<h5 id="Reset_.3E_Soft.2FMixed.2FHard">Reset &gt; Soft/Mixed/Hard</h5>
		<p>This action resets the Repository containing the current input to the currently selected commit. Depending on the choice of the sub-menu, a soft, mixed, or hard reset will be performed.</p>
		<h5 id="Quickdiff_.3E_Reset_Quickdiff_Basline_to_HEAD">Quickdiff &gt; Reset Quickdiff Basline to HEAD</h5>
		<h5 id="Quickdiff_.3E_Reset_Quickdiff_Basline_to_first_parent_of_HEAD">Quickdiff &gt; Reset Quickdiff Basline to first parent of HEAD</h5>
		<p>These two actions set the quickdiff basline for the repository to HEAD or to the parent of HEAD. These actions are always available, even if more than one commit is selected.</p>
		<h5 id="Quickdiff_.3E_Set_as_Baseline_.3D">Quickdiff &gt; Set as Baseline =</h5>
		<p>This action is only available if a single commit is selected; it will st the quickdiff baseline for the repository to the selected commit.</p>
		<h5 id="Copy">Copy</h5>
		<p>Copies the IDs of the currently selected commit or commits into the clipboard.</p>
		<h5 id="Show_Revision_Comment">Show Revision Comment</h5>
		<p>Toggles the visibility of the Revision Comment area.</p>
		<h5 id="Show_Revision_Details">Show Revision Details</h5>
		<p>Toggles the visibility of the Revision Details area.</p>
		<h5 id="Wrap_Comments">Wrap Comments</h5>
		<p>Only available when right-clicking on the Revision Comment area. If active, the comments will be auto-wrapped to fill the display area, otherwise the wrapping of the commit message will be used.</p>
		<h5 id="Fill_Paragraphs">Fill Paragraphs</h5>
		<p>Only available when right-clicking on the Revision Comment area. If active, the commit message will be displayed without unnecessary line breaks.</p>
		<h3 id="Synchronize_View">Synchronize View</h3>
		<p>A Git synchronization launched using the Team &gt; Synchronize menu command will appear in the Synchronize view. This view allows you to inspect the differences between the resources in the local workspace and a local or remote tracking branch. Alternatively you may compare a local and a remote tracking branch. Comparison of two remote tracking branches as well as menu commands on the Synchronize View are not yet available in this EGit version and will be provided in a future release.</p>
		<p>Here is what the Git Synchronize View looks like:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-synchronize-overview.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Synchronization_State">Synchronization State</h4>
		<p>The Synchronize View shows the synchronization state of resources in your workspace or a local branch compared to those in another local or remote tracking branch representing the state of a branch from a remote repository. This state is shown by using icons and can also be configured to show the state as text appended to the resource name. </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-synchronize-overview-labels.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>A description of the icons is shown in the table below:</p>
		<table class="wikitable">

				</td>
				<td>A conflicting change means that the file has been changed in your workspace or local branch and in the target branch. A manual or automatic merge will be required. Also, any entries in the view that contain children that are conflicts will also be decorated with the conflict icon. This is done to make conflicts easy to find.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>

		</table>
		<h4 id="Mode">Mode</h4>
		<p>The Synchronize View can be filtered using modes using either the toolbar actions or the menu items in the view's drop down menu. Modes can be used to show only incoming, outgoing or conflicting changes.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-synchronize-mode.png"/>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Models">Models</h4>
		<p>The Synchronize View is capable of displaying different model representations of the resources. Each product may contain its own product specific representations. The Eclipse SDK comes with three models:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Workspace Model: displays a resource based model. Layout options for this model can be controlled from the Preferences dialog in the drop down menu. The layout options for the Workspace model are
				<dl>
					<dt>Flat layout: shows all the out-of-sync resources as direct children of their project.</dt>
					<dt>Tree layout: shows the resource hierarchy as it is shown in the Project Explorer.</dt>
					<dt>Compress Folders: shows changes grouped by project and then by folder. This results in a hierarchy that is at most three levels deep with folder paths being compressed into a single level (similar to a Java package).</dt>
				</dl>
			</dt>
			<dt>Java Model: displays a Java based model (similar to what appears in the Package Explorer).</dt>
			<dt>Change Sets: displays a Change Set based model. This model shows incoming changes grouped by commit comment which is handy for seeing who released what and why. For outgoing changes, you can create Change Sets for grouping related changes together. Grouping is performed using various commands in the context menu.</dt>
		</dl>
		<p>In addition to to the models, there is also a
			<b>Flat Presentation</b> which displays all the out-of-sync elements as top level elements.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Navigation">Navigation</h4>
		<p>The Synchronize view provides toolbar actions for navigating through the changes in the view. These actions not only navigate between files but also go from change to change within a file.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Egit-0.9-synchronize-navigation.png"/>
		</p>
		<h2 id="Git_URLs">Git URLs</h2>
		<p>Git URLs in general consist of transport protocol scheme, address of the remote server and the repository path within the remote server and for some authenticating protocols also the user ID.</p>
		<p>EGit supports the following protocols</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>file</b> - Direct file system access to the repository.
			</li>
			<li>

		<h2 id="Git_References">Git References</h2>
		<p>Git References are also known shortly as
			<b>Refs</b>.

			<br/>They comprise
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>branches </li>
			<li>remote-tracking branches </li>
			<li>tags </li>
		</ul>
		<p>They all are named with a path using '/' as path separator and are starting with "refs". </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Local branches start with "refs/heads/"</li>
			<li>Remote tracking branches start with "refs/remotes/". Remote tracking branches proxy branches located in a remote repository so that their state at the time of the last transport operation can be queried also when no connection to the repository is available (offline).</li>
			<li>Tags start with "refs/tags/"</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Ref names can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviated form is unique.

			<br/>E.g.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>"master" is short for "refs/heads/master"</li>
			<li>"origin/master" is short for "refs/remotes/origin/master"</li>
			<li>"v1.0.1" is short for "refs/tags/v1.0.1"</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For a complete list for Ref names and the order of precedence if multiple references have the same shorthand form see the section "Specifying Revisions" section of
			<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html" target="egit_external">git rev-parse</a>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Refspecs">Refspecs</h2>
		<p>A "refspec" is used by fetch and push operations to describe the mapping between remote
			<a href="Reference.html#Git_References">Ref</a> and local
			<a href="Reference.html#Git_References">Ref</a>. Semantically they define how local branches or tags are mapped to branches or tags in a remote repository. In native git they are combined with a colon in the format &lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;, preceded by an optional plus sign, + to denote forced update. In EGit they can be displayed and also edited in tabular form in the
			<a href="Tasks.html#Push_Ref_Specifications">Push Ref Specification</a> and the
			<a href="Tasks.html#Fetch_Ref_Specifications">Fetch Ref Specification</a> dialogs.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Remotes">Remotes</h2>
		<p>Remotes are used to manage the repositories ("remotes") whose branches you track from your repository.</p>
		<p>In EGit Remotes are defined when </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="Tasks.html#Cloning_Remote_Repositories">Cloning a repository</a> from another repository, by convention this repository the newly cloned one has been created from is named "origin". If you prefer a different name the clone wizard allows to specify that.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="Tasks.html#Remote_Repositories">Defining Remotes in the Repositories View</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A Remote first of all defines a
			<b>name</b> for the repository whose branches you track, this is important since you may want to track branches from different repositories so the name helps to understand what repository a certain operation is dealing with. In addition
			<a href="Reference.html#Refspecs">Refspecs</a> specified for a given Remote define a
			<b>mapping of branches and tags</b> in your local repository to branches and tags in the remote repository. You may want to use different mappings for inbound or outbound transport operations hence there are
			<a href="Tasks.html#Cloning_Remote_Repositories">editors</a> to define Fetch and Push Configurations available in EGit.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Git_Ignore">Git Ignore</h2>
		<p><code>.gitignore</code> files located in the working tree specify files that intentionally should not be tracked by git. They only concern files that are not yet tracked by git. In order to ignore uncommitted changes in already tracked files refer to the
			<a href="Reference.html#Menu_Actions">assume unchanged action</a>.
		</p>
		<p>Each line in <code>.gitignore</code> files defines a pattern. Git checks ignore patterns following the hierarchy of the working tree from highest to lowest. Patterns defined in higher level <code>.gitignore</code> files are overridden by those defined in lower levels.
			Files which shall be ignored for all working on a given project are usually included in the project's repository to easily share them in the team.</p>
		<p>Pattern format definition:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>blank lines are ignored</li>
			<li>lines starting with
				<b>#</b> serve as comments
			</li>
			<li>the optional prefix
				<b>!</b> negates the pattern. Files excluded by a matching previous pattern become included again. Patterns ending with a slash only match directories but not files or symbolic links.
			</li>
			<li>patterns not containing a slash are treated as shell glob patterns matched against the path relative to the location of the .gitignore file</li>
			<li>git treats patterns as shell globs as defined in
				<a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/fnmatch.3.html" target="egit_external">fnmatch(3)</a>
			</li>
			<li>wildcards in patterns do not match
				<b>/</b> in path names
			</li>
			<li>a leading slash matches the beginning of a pathname</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The EGit
			<b>Ignore</b>
			<a href="Reference.html#Menu_Actions">menu action</a> adds the selected resource to the <code>.gitignore</code> file in the resource's parent directory. To enter other ignore patterns use a text editor.
