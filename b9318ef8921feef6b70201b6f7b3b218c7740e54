With all environments defined here, Tycho (1.7.0 or 2.4.0) somehow includes all SWT versions. With Java 11, this leads to split packages, and one cannot compile UI code anymore: \"The type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files.\"\n\nThe downside is that we now get warnings about the build being platform-dependent.\n\nI don\u0027t know what the correct way would be to define environments.\n\nI could remove it altogether; leaving it in comments could serve as a reminder that there is something still not quite right in the Java 11 build.",
