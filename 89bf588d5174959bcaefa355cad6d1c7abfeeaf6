      "message": "Yes, but how did lastHead get to be null in the first place? I think that can happen only if head \u003d\u003d null earlier, and in that case, it\u0027s probably not a good idea to update anything. So I agree with Michael that\n\n  if (head !\u003d null \u0026\u0026 !Objects.equals(lastHead, head))\n\nwould be safer.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m rather surprised that JGit\u0027s RenameBranchCommand leaves us with a temporary state that is inconsistent (HEAD already set to the new branch, which doesn\u0027t exist yet at that point), and advertises this intermediary state even with a RefsChangedEvent. I wonder if we could improve that in JGit such that either HEAD is always valid (preferred) or that at least we only get a single event after the whole rename is through.",
