- __org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui__: bundle implementing a user interface
    for the gitflow branching model.
- __org.eclipse.egit.target__: Eclipse target platform providing EGit
    3rd party dependencies for the build and for running EGit in Eclipse
    workspace.
- __org.eclipse.egit.ui__: An Eclipse plugin providing the user interface on
    top of org.eclipse.egit.core.
- __org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer__: An Eclipse plugin integrating the Eclipse
    smart import wizard to improve importing projects from Git repositories.

- __org.eclipse.egit.core.test__: Unit tests for org.eclipse.egit.core.
- __org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.test__: Unit tests for org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.
- __org.eclipse.egit.ui.importer.test__: UI tests for org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport.
- __org.eclipse.egit.ui.test__: UI tests for org.eclipse.egit.ui.

### Packaging

    Raw documentation is written in the [wiki](https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide).
- __org.eclipse.egit-feature__: Eclipse feature for installing the core
    implementation bundles
- __org.eclipse.egit.gitflow-feature__: Eclipse feature for installing the
    optional gitflow bundle.

    source bundles to help debugging EGit in Eclipse.

## Compatibility

- In general, EGit supports at least the latest two Eclipse releases.
  For details, please see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/FAQ
- JGit and EGit releases are versioned according to
  [OSGi semantic versioning](https://www.osgi.org/wp-content/uploads/SemanticVersioning.pdf)
- Newer version of EGit may implement new functionality, remove
  existing functions and change others without other notice than what
  is written in the release notes, commit log and source files themselves.
