It\u0027s unrelated to this change; also occurred before. Try adding the Gerrit change ID and a sign-off footer while having the message empty. Yes, it\u0027s something more to improve, but maybe not in this change.\n\n\u003e - add some tests ?\n\nYeah. Would have to look if this can be tested without having to do a UI test, and if not, what would need to be refactored.\n\nI\u0027ll be away for two weeks now; so this is something for for a later release then.",
