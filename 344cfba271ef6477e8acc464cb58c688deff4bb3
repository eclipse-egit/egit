If we want that, then I guess the change in the UI MANIFEST and probably also in the one file in the core tests need to be undone.\n\nOtherwise I have now a way for that RefFilterHelperTest to avoid using the mixture of mockito and hamcrest matchers via argThat(): use a mockito ArgumentCaptor to capture the argument, then use hamcrest assertThat together with the hamcrest matcher.",
