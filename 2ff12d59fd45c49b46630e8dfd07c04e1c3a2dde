      "message": "Is this a good way to categorize issues? In Apache MINA sshd, I use a different approach: I manually tag things once I\u0027ve taken a look at the issue. Some issues are simply invalid, not bugs; some bugs are actually feature requests. This avoids having things tagged \"bug\" that aren\u0027t.\n\nManual intervention is required anyway. If we tag automatically, we have to double-check and remove labels if inappropriate. But I kind of prefer the labels to mean that an issue is a \"confirmed bug\".\n\nIn the end I don\u0027t really care; I suppose either way will work.",
