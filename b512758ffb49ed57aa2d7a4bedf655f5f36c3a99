      "message": "All right: the build succeeded because the JGit change isn\u0027t merged yet. The JGit 7.5.0-SNAPSHOT p2 repo still contains org.slf4j 1.7.36, so the build was able to satisfy the above constraint that way.\n\n\nThe bounds of the import should be changed to [1.7.0,3.0.0), and this change must be held back until the JGit change https://eclipse.gerrithub.io/c/eclipse-jgit/jgit/+/1225024 has been merged and the post-merge build is done. Then this change needs to be retriggered.",
